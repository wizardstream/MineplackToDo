Here’s a **chaotically comedic README** (100% not written by AI) you can use for your GitHub repo, tailored to your app and its quirks:

```markdown
# 🪓 Mineplack ToDo

**The one and only terminal todo app you never knew you needed.**  

Manage your tasks like a true professional goblin miner, with a splash of unhinged command-line energy.  
Why use Notion, Trello, or sticky notes when you can wrestle with a text-based interface and weirdly formatted save files?

## 🤖 What is this?

Mineplack ToDo is a beautifully absurd CLI-based todo list manager written in Go.  
It features all the basic functionality you need to procrastinate in style:

- Add tasks
- Mark them done
- Delete them
- List them
- Aggressively clear your screen

---

## 🗂 Where does it save my precious thoughts?

Oh, you mean the tasks you’ll totally finish?  

It saves your tasks **inside your home directory**, in a top-secret folder:  

```

\~/mineplacktodo/tasks.nasin

````

> ✨ Pro tip: "nasin" means "way" or "path" in Toki Pona. You're welcome for that random fact.

---

## 💥 How do I use this chaotic masterpiece?

1️⃣ Fire it up:

```bash
go run main.go
````

or if you’ve already built it:

```bash
./MineplackToDo
```

2️⃣ You’ll see a fancy "Mineplack ToDo" header that makes you feel like you're about to hack the mainframe.

3️⃣ Type commands! Here’s the arsenal:

```
add <task>      => Add something you’ll forget to do
list            => List your endless regrets (tasks)
done <number>   => Mark a task as "done" (lie to yourself)
delete <number> => Delete evidence of your failures
clear           => Clear the screen and your conscience
help            => Summon the divine command list
exit            => Rage quit
```

## 🧾 Example session

```
> add Build a rocket
Added: Build a rocket

> list
1. [ ] Build a rocket

> done 1
Marked done: Build a rocket

> list
1. [x] Build a rocket

> delete 1
Deleted: Build a rocket

> list
No tasks.
```

## ⚠️ Known quirks

* Will aggressively create `~/mineplacktodo` if it doesn’t exist. Consider this your new digital shrine.
* Format of `tasks.nasin` is so custom it might make XML cry.
* No syncing, no priorities, no colors, no nonsense. Just pure text-based soul.

## 💬 Final words

✨ **Happy hacking (or procrastinating)!** ✨
